Let them get it all out. They will often calm down if they can just get everything out. If they don't want to talk about it then let it go for now. Just be there in case when they do want to talk. It helps a lot to know that someone cares enough to listen to you without trying to \"fix\" things. And also, make sure they understand why this change happened. Maybe their other parent was having trouble taking care of them before so they had to move back in. Explain it as much as they can handle."}

If it doesn't bother her in the mornings and she can sleep fine with lights off, there's nothing wrong with her having an irrational fear of the dark. But if it becomes a problem, it might be time to look into therapy. Edit: It might also help to get a night light for her room so she doesn't have to rely on her phone flashlight all night. That way she can still see but isn't staring at a bright screen when she's trying to sleep. There are even different colors that they make (I believe) which may be more calming than white light. Good luck!"}

Don't dwell on it, don't make it into some big mystery or \"issue\". The most important thing is to avoid euphemisms (\"passed away\", \"went to sleep\") as they tend to confuse children. Be frank about it and answer any questions honestly. It doesn't need to be an in-depth discussion of life\/death\/religion\/eternity\/etc...but just a simple, straightforward explanation should suffice. Good luck! :) Edit: I forgot to add that I think it's perfectly fine for kids to have pets die at an early age."}

This won't be perfect because both jobs are demanding. It will never feel like enough time for either. But there are things you can do to make sure each job gets done. For example, if you have a call scheduled, block off the entire hour in advance. If possible, have someone else take care of the kiddo during this hour. (Or schedule this call at bedtime.) On days when you have a meeting, plan some fun activities with the kiddo after. And vice versa. Plan something special for yourself if you don't have anything going on with work."}

If he doesn't get his homework done in time then he gets a zero and has to make up the work during recess. He can't play sports if he doesn't follow rules (eg, not practicing) so he loses out on that privilege. Punishment does nothing other than teach kids that they don't need to take responsibility for their own actions. Natural consequences give them ownership of what happens as a result of their behavior. There is no confusion here because we are consistent with this approach. And when there is a problem we sit down together and talk through it."}

Most offer part time care as well as full time so check them out."}

At snack time she could have whatever she wanted as long as it was healthy (ie fruit, veggies). It ended up being a good thing because it gave us an opportunity to talk about healthy food choices and what makes something a meal versus a snack. Now that she's older she still asks for a snack sometimes during dinner, which can just be a small portion of her main meal. She also gets to pick out the snacks we have available. This works well because she has some control in the situation while learning about moderation and nutrition. Good luck!"}

Your three year old is having a hard time adjusting because his world has changed so much. He used to be the only one of you that needed anything. Now there is someone else to compete with. Your best bet is to tell him that you love him and give him lots of extra hugs and kisses when you can. When he wants something, explain what you are doing for the other person and why it is important, then explain that you will do the same thing for him after you finish helping the other person. Make sure that you spend plenty of one-on-one time with him as well, if possible."}

If they come into your room tell them you love them and that you will talk to them in the morning. Stay consistent with this. The first few days are rough because they have no idea what is going on. But if you stick to your guns you will get through it! Good luck! :-) Edit: I forgot to mention you need to do all this before bed. So, put them down, then stay consistent with everything else. They will be cranky\/mad\/confused at first, but once they know what is happening things will go much better. This works great if they are already used to sleeping alone (which my son was)."}

Or if they know you have a favorite fruit you love that might be enough distraction for them. But yeah, this is normal and happens sometimes. Try not to feel bad about it. Most people will understand. As long as it's not super frequent, it'll be ok. And remember, the more time you spend trying to prevent it from happening, the less time they're going to be able to practice dealing with disappointment."}

Just keep offering her different things and don't worry if she doesn't want to try them. That way there is no pressure on her and she can enjoy the day without feeling stressed about food. As for your family, they should respect that you have kids with special dietary needs (not all kids are picky). If they ask why she isn't trying something, tell them it is because of her dietary restrictions and leave it at that. They should understand that you cannot force your kid to eat something she does not want to eat."}

They can always snack later when they get home. Otherwise, we only offer one dish at each meal. If they choose not to eat what we serve, that's their choice but there aren't any alternatives. It does take some getting used to, but once they realize that there isn't going to be an alternative offered they will start eating more of whatever is being served. The other thing is to let them decide how much they want to eat. This way they can control their own intake and learn from experience when they feel too full."}

I wouldn't worry about it unless you suspect that there is something wrong with her (such as illness). A good book to read is \"How Full is Your Bucket?\" by Daniel Goleman. The basic idea is that everyone has a bucket that they fill up every day. When someone fills yours up, your bucket gets fuller. And when you do something nice for someone else, their bucket goes up. Sometimes people have a lot of problems in life because they don't get enough positive things happening to them, so their buckets stay empty. Kids need lots of attention from parents, even when they grow up."}

If you can get them involved in some activity that doesn't involve screens, even better!

If they throw themselves down, pick them up and say \u201cwe\u2019re going\u201d again. They won\u2019t enjoy this and will probably scream and cry but eventually you will be leaving so they have no other option than to stop resisting. It took my kiddo a few months to learn this, but she\u2019s 3 now and is great about transitions. Also, make sure to bring plenty of snacks\/water\/sunscreen etc. This helps keep her happy while we play. Sometimes I even let her help me pack up before we leave. She likes helping, and feels included."}

Set aside time every day for calls so they can talk to their grandparents, uncles\/aunts, cousins, etc... It will give them something to look forward to everyday, and make the holidays special. The added bonus is that you get to catch up with your family too. When my son was little we did this for Christmas. My mom got him an early gift of some kind each year (it could be anything from a teddy bear to a book). Then she called us and talked to him about it. He looked forward to those calls all week. Now as he gets older, we still try to do this."}

It may take a couple days for them to realize that their response is being ignored, but once they get it, they will stop doing it. Also remember that kids can only respond at their level, so there isn't anything wrong with repeating yourself every time until they understand. They aren't trying to make life harder for you, they just don't understand yet and need more help than most adults. Try to explain things as many times as possible without getting frustrated, and try to stay calm even though it's hard."}

Have a variety of things available. And don't forget snacks! When my daughter was in school we used to have a bag of mini snickers bars, a few clementines, an apple, some crackers with cheese, and maybe some goldfish. If they don't eat all their lunch, save it for dinner. That way they won't be tempted to buy junk food at the cafeteria when they see their friends with it.

The toy is passed around in a circle and each person gets one turn to add something to it. They can say whatever they want as long as its positive but everyone has to agree for someone else's idea to go through. Sometimes, it leads to some pretty elaborate structures but most of the time people just come up with simple things. For example, today my son made an entire rainbow out of Duplo blocks that he wanted me to pass along to his friend. It was awesome! He said that if his friend didn't accept it then it wasn't fair because everyone should get a chance to contribute."}

The first thing we learned is that most beds with rails will not work in this situation because they don't have railings that drop down enough for them to climb over. A lot of people suggest Ikea Kura beds (the one without a mattress base) as being really good for transitioning kids from cribs. Some other suggestions include using a bedrail system with any existing bed or putting their mattress on the floor and letting them use a small box spring\/mattress as a ramp to get into bed. All these things will allow them to be safe while also having some independence."}

If you use it sparingly and infrequently, then you shouldn't worry too much about it. Also, if he is playing educational games (like math or reading), then that may help alleviate some guilt. Just remember that there's nothing wrong with needing a break, and it won't harm him in the long run.

If he\u2019s just being strict then that might be a good thing but if you don\u2019t want to go along with his disciplining methods then talk to him about it and come up with some other way that you both agree with. Or at least try. He probably doesn\u2019t know how hard it is to make those decisions either. Also, have you tried looking into a counselor\/therapist? They can help with things like this and they are usually really nice people. Sometimes we need someone else to give us advice. Hopefully something here helps! :) Edit: sorry for the late reply!"}

If he rolls off his mattress, he will most likely land on carpeted floor which is much better than landing on hardwood or tile floors. He may also need some assistance getting back into the bed but it shouldn't take long for him to figure this part out. Also consider putting a railing around the bed for extra safety. There are plenty of options online. Good luck! I hope this helps! :) EDIT: Check out [this article]( It has lots of good information as well as links to other articles with more info.

If the light was off when we came to get her, then we knew she wasn't asleep (and thus wouldn't let us put her back down) so she had to go back to bed. The egg timer helped because if she got out of bed and played too long, it was very clear to both of us how much longer until we'd come to check on her again.

They can just go into another room. But if there is no real issue with the arguments then this will probably be the case for years as the kids grow up and eventually become adults themselves. There will always be something to argue about. This is how people learn to live with others and work out issues. Maybe you can teach them how to argue effectively and reach compromises rather than making things worse. That way they will learn that talking things through helps rather than trying to force an opinion on someone else. That also means telling them to stop arguing when it starts getting too intense so they know when to back off."}

Basically, they teach you how to interact with others and make friends. Good luck! It gets easier when everyone starts settling into their routines. And remember that it takes time. This stuff doesn\u2019t happen overnight. Edit: another tip is to see if there\u2019s a neighborhood Facebook page."}

He also helps me around the house whenever I ask him to. I think this age is really great because they can be very independent and responsible. It depends on what chores you have. If you have a dishwasher then that will save time and make things easier to clean. If you don't have one and you do a lot of hand washing then maybe start out small. Cleaning the counter tops every night and wiping down the sink before bed. Then as he gets older you can give him bigger tasks. Also remember to reward them when they do something good."}

When someone is old (like Grandma) they have lived longer than many other people. They know that sooner or later they will be dead so they make plans for how things should be handled after they pass away. Talking about these issues helps people come to terms with mortality and lessens fear of death. If anyone asks why he was talking about such sad topics tell them that he had been thinking about it because his grandpa passed away last year. It's good to think about these things. Encourage him to talk about this more if he wants. Ask him what he thinks might happen when someone dies."}

At the same time, I would talk about what kind of friends she wants and what she expects from her friends. If she doesn't think the girls she's hanging around are good enough for her, then maybe they aren't. Then again, if you just hang out with popular kids, all you end up doing is being the second most popular kid, so that might be worth considering as well. There isn't really a right answer. It depends on whether she values popularity more than having close friends, which is something you need to figure out together."}

When my parents got divorced my dad was single for several years before he re-married, but my mom started introducing her boyfriends almost immediately after she left. They were never permanent fixtures and it just caused confusion and pain for me. This doesn't mean that your new partner can't meet your child, but it should be done at their own pace with time for everyone to adjust. It also might help to involve a therapist to mediate these conversations and help make sure everything goes smoothly. Good luck!"}

It took me about a month of dropping her off crying before I realized that what she really needed was just to be told by me that she could go back home whenever she wanted. After that, it only took one or two days for her to stop crying every time. For some reason my son is different in that he doesn't care about coming home so much as being away from mommy and daddy.
